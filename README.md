# Linear Regression with Polynomial Features
This program implements linear regression with polynomial features using the sklearn library in Python. The program uses a training set of data and plots a prediction using the Linear Regression model.

## Requirements
The following libraries are required to run the program:

+ Python
+ numpy
+ matplotlib
+ sklearn

## Data
The program uses two sets of data for bluegill fish - training set and testing set.

+ The training set consists of 10 data points with age of bluegill in years and its corresponding length in millimeters. 
+ The testing set consists of 10 data points with age of bluegill in years and its corresponding length in millimeters.

## Functionality
The program performs the following operations:

1. Trains a Linear Regression model using the training set data.
2. Sets the degree of the polynomial regression model.
3. Transforms the input data matrix into a new data matrix of a given degree using the PolynomialFeatures preprocessor.
4. Trains and tests the polynomial regression model.
5. Plots a graph of the training data and the prediction using the linear and polynomial regression models.

## Conclusion
This program demonstrates the use of polynomial features in linear regression using the sklearn library. The program trains and tests the polynomial regression model and plots a graph to visualize the results.
